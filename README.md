###Problems using SVN?
> Download the latest source package: http://code.google.com/p/video-chat/downloads/detail?name=RVC4.0.fxp

> Explore changes and update your copy: http://code.google.com/p/video-chat/source/list

for example, you download RVC 4.0 (*r2*) and the latest revision is (*r5*), click on (*r5*) and you see a *Log message* and *Affected files*. Expand the file details with *+* or by clicking on *diff*

_Make sure you are comparing (*r2*) to (*r5*) and NOT (*r3*) or (*r4*) to (*r5*), on the top middle you should see *r2 vs. r5*. If you see something else click *Edit* (obviously, if you are comparing (r3) to (r14), the top middle should say (r3) vs. (r14))_
